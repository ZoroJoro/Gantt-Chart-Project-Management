## Introduction

A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that represents a project schedule. This script uses `pandas` and `matplotlib` to create a Gantt chart from a list of tasks with their start and end dates.

## Features

- Create a Gantt chart from a list of tasks with start and end dates
- Customize the appearance of the Gantt chart
- Automatically format the dates on the x-axis

## Installation

To run the script, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:
- pandas
- matplotlib

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Gantt-Chart-Project-Management.git
cd Gantt-Chart-Project-Management
```

2. Modify the list of tasks in the script to fit your project. Each task should have a name, start date, and end date.

3. Run the script:

```bash
python gantt_chart.py
```

4. The Gantt chart will be displayed in a new window.
